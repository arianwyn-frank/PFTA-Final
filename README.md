Bible Translation Comparison
Created by Mert, Ari, and Artorius, this project explores and compares textual variations across four Bible translations: KJV, NASB, NET, and TLB

Project Goals
The aim of this project is to:
- Quantitatively compare the language, length, and structure of various Bible translations
- Focus on the Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John) for a controlled comparative lens
- Enable further literary and linguistic insights into translation styles

Text Cleaning
- Text extraction and cleaning for KJV, NASB, NET, and TLB translations
- Data frame creation for each translation, with standardized columns:
- Filtering for Gospel books for focused comparison
- Preparation of chapter-level text for downstream analysis (e.g., sentiment, word counts, similarity measures)

Data Sources
- GitHub Bible Texts (variety-bible-text)
